The LyChI library currently relies on the JChem library version 3.2
from Chemaxon (chemaxon.com) for basic IO and aromatic and stereo
perception. This version of JChem is no longer supported by Chemaxon.
If you intend on using LyChI for anything substantial, we encourage
you to communicate with Chemaxon to let them know of your intent.
