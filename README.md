LyChI (Layered Chemical Identifier)
===================================

This directory contains code for BARD structure standardizer. To build
simply type

```
ant
```

To build a self-contained jar with dependencies included, use `ant
all` instead. The self-contained jar file can be invoked directly;
e.g., 

```
java -jar dist/lychi-all-v0.1.jar tests/standardizer_case1.smi
```
